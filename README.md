During my course's final project, I developed a comprehensive game titled "Jak Mars." This project involved several key components and systems that I meticulously designed and implemented:


Functional Systems: I built a fully functional Main Menu, Pause, Quit Game, and Game Over systems, ensuring a seamless user experience from start to finish.

Level Design: I designed and implemented a detailed level that included landscape, foliage, materials, and static meshes, creating an immersive environment for players.

Interactive Objects: I created various interactive objects to enhance player engagement and interactivity within the game world.

Enemy AI Integration: I integrated multiple enemy AI entities using a shared AI system, providing dynamic and challenging gameplay experiences.

Gameplay Mechanics: I developed intricate gameplay mechanics for character movements and abilities, ensuring smooth and responsive controls.

User Interface (UI): I programmed and implemented user interface elements, including health bars, gun ammunition, and in-game menus, to provide clear and intuitive feedback to players.

Sound Design: I incorporated sound effects and background music to enhance the game's atmosphere and create an immersive audio experience.


This project allowed me to apply and expand my skills in game development, from designing engaging levels to implementing complex systems and mechanics. It was a valuable experience that showcased my ability to create a cohesive and enjoyable gaming experience.
